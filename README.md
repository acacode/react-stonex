Created a project with a bit stable version


### Changed  
- renamed `lib` to `src` folder (reason: `lib` is needed for production files)  
- prettified a `.gitignore`
- added new `devDependencies` to `package.json` and also new required properties for build
- big changes in the source code. Rewrited fully all `index.js`

### Added  
- rollup builds! Hooray!
- `index.d.ts` typings
- Travis CI builds
